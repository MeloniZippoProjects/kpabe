kpabe-setup \- manual page for kpabe-setup 0.10
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kpabe-setup
[\fIOPTION \fR...] \fIATTR \fR[\fIATTR \fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Generate system parameters, a public key, and a master secret key
for use with kpabe\-keygen, kpabe\-enc, and kpabe\-dec.
.PP
Attributes come in two forms: non\-numerical and numerical. Non\-numerical
attributes are simply any string of letters, digits, and underscores
beginning with a letter.
.PP
Numerical attributes are specified as `attr = N', where N is a non\-negative
integer less than 2^64 and `attr' is another string. The whitespace around
the `=' is optional. One may specify an explicit length of k bits for the
integer by giving `attr = N#k'. Note that any comparisons in a policy given
to kpabe\-keygen (1) must then specify the same number of bits, e.g.,
`attr > 5#12'.
.PP
The keywords `and', `or', and `of', are reserved for the policy language
of kpabe\-keygen (1) and may not be used for either type of attribute.
.PP
Output will be written to the files "pub_key" and "master_key"
unless the \fB\-\-output\-public\-key\fR or \fB\-\-output\-master\-key\fR options are
used.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
