.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kpabe-enc
[\fIOPTION \fR...] \fIPUB_KEY FILE ATTR \fR[\fIATTR \fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Encrypt FILE under a set of attributes(ATTR) using public key
PUB_KEY. The encrypted file will be written to FILE.kpabe unless
the \fB\-o\fR option is used. The original file will be removed.
Attributes come in two forms: non\-numerical and numerical. Non\-numerical
attributes are simply any string of letters, digits, and underscores
beginning with a letter.
.PP
Numerical attributes are specified as `attr = N', where N is a non\-negative
integer less than 2^64 and `attr' is another string. The whitespace around
the `=' is optional. One may specify an explicit length of k bits for the
integer by giving `attr = N#k'. Note that any comparisons in a policy given
to kpabe\-enc(1) must then specify the same number of bits, e.g.,
`attr > 5#12'.
.PP
The keywords `and', `or', and `of', are reserved for the policy language
of kpabe\-enc (1) and may not be used for either type of attribute.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
