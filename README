Fixed Errors
============

The original repository had a few errors that we fixed.

1. Calculation of max integer on N bits in policy creation: 
	The original code didn't work for N = 64.
	Corrected in commit 2cc5161, and refactored name in e108110.
	
2. Calculation of max integer on N bits in attribute parsing:
	The original code didn't work for N = 64.
	Corrected in commits 32f8f00, fc1aa73, 5115af5
	
3. Makefile not working in gcc or g++:
	The original makefile had dependencies specified in such an order
	that gcc ignored some of them. 
	Corrected in commit c2be48b
